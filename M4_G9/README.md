# CausalLOB — Milestone 4 (Final Submission)

CSE 516 | Probabilistic Graphical Models | Group G9

CausalLOB is an interpretable Dynamic Bayesian Network for studying limit-order-book dynamics using 394,337 FI-2010 observations. It combines LPCMCI-based temporal structure discovery, Gaussian parameter learning, exact Bayesian inference, and probabilistic price-movement forecasting.

The frozen model contains 39 temporal parent connections and is evaluated against AR(5), VAR(5), random-graph alternatives, and DeepLOB. Results show modest improvements in selected reconstruction tasks, while DeepLOB performs better in forecasting.

This folder contains the final research report, technical presentation, video walkthrough, frozen notebooks and checkpoints, reproducibility scripts, dataset documentation, and experimental results.

The project builds on M1–M3 and includes statistical evaluation, robustness testing, failure analysis, and revised SOTA positioning.

**Dataset:** FI-2010 NoAuction Decimal Precision  
**Status:** Final research submission (M4)
